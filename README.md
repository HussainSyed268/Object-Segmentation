This python project works on object segmentation in digital images using opencv and numpy.

# Target Image
In this project we are using a picture of bunch of coins as our target image. It is an RGB image hence containing 3 channels

# Task - 1
Resizing the target image to 256x256 pixels.

# Task - 2
Converted the target image from RGB to Gray scale. It now includes 1 channel.

# Task - 3
Converted the target image from RGB to Binary.

# Task - 4 
Finally the target object i.e the coins in the image are segmented and border boxes are drawn around them. The quantity of the target objects has also been taken in regard.
